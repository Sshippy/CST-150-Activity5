# CST-150-Activity5
Write a Windows Form Application that uses a file dialog control to allow the user to select a file for input, processing the contents of the file as follows: 1. Converts all the words to lower-case. 2. Finds the first and last word alphabetically. 3. Finds the longest word. 4. Finds the word with the most vowels.

What did you learn?
What I learned from this assignment was how to access data files, which I feel is a very important tool to know when doing any programming. I also learned how to create a code that changes words to lower case, find the first and last word alphabetically, find the word that is the longest as well as finding a word that has the most vowels. This is all great information to learn, and I am thankful that it was successful.

What were the challenges if any?
The biggest challenge I faced with this assignment was the opem dialog. I forgot to put it in the first time, and the file did not read, so I thought it was some other error, and I re did the whole thing. When I put it in on the second one, I was able to overcome the challenge.
